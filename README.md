# GYLT: Get Your Life Together

GYLT is an all-in-one personal management tool designed to help you organize and streamline essential aspects of your life. Currently, the app focuses on two key features:

- *Habit Tracker:* Track your daily, weekly, or monthly habits, set goals, and visualize your progress.

- *Subscription Manager:* Manage your subscriptions, get renewal alerts, and prevent unexpected charges.

More features (Health Tracker, To-Do List, Pomodoro Timer, Budget Tracker) are in the pipeline and will be added as bonus features in future updates.
